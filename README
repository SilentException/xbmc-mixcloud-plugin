Howto retrieve an oauth token

  In order to use the "favorites" and "following"
  features one needs to setup an oauth token.

  Unfortunately this is not automated yet,
  and due to XBMC's lack of a browser its not
  so easy to overcome. Here is how to get a
  token:

  * Login to Mixcloud

  * Open
    https://www.mixcloud.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=Vef7HWkSjCzEFvdhet&redirect_uri=http://www.mixcloud.com

  * Accept. This will take you to
    http://www.mixcloud.com/?code=OAUTH_CODE
    Make sure to remember the OAUTH_CODE for later usage.

  * Open
    https://www.mixcloud.com/oauth/access_token?client_id=Vef7HWkSjCzEFvdhet&redirect_uri=http://www.mixcloud.com&client_secret=VK7hwemnZWBexDbnVZqXLapVbPK3FFYT&code=OAUTH_CODE
    Make sure to replace OAUTH_CODE in this URL with the previously retrieved code.

  * That's it. You should see a page now with your access token.
    Open the plugin config, fill in the token and enjoy :)
